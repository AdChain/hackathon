# adChain Registry 1.0 Hackathon
**When**: April 8th â€“ 9th, 2019  
**Where**: Los Angeles Convention Center  

### HACKATHON GOAL
While primarily focusing on the [adChain Publisher Registry](https://publisher.adchain.com/), hackathon participants are to analyze various factors within the [Token-Curated Registry (TCR) 1.0](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7) mechanism and generate observations/recommendations for the adChain team. The various factors to be analyzed include (but are not limited to):

**Overall Problems**  
- What immediate problems do you observe when analyzing TCR 1.0? What recommendations can you provide in order to improve the game mechanics?

**Curation Incentives**  
- How could ADT holders be better incentivized to curate the registry?
- Take in mind the fact that ADT is already distributed and can be acquired in the secondary market

**Smart Contract Organization**  
- How could the [TCR smart contracts](https://github.com/skmgoldin/tcr) be developed for optimization purposes?
- Explore the possibility of deploying the smart contracts on a second-layer solution or an entire separate blockchain while keeping the existing Ethereum-based digital assets in mind

**Registry UX**  
- What tools/wallets could be utilized to optimize user experience for the purpose of curation?

**Attack Vectors**  
- Based on the crypto economic mechanics within TCR 1.0, what attack vectors could be exploited to the game the registry?

### HACKATHON JUDGING CRITERIA
The MetaX team will be judging submissions based on the creativity and actionable recommendations generated by hackathon participants. Because TCRs have been in existence for about two years, [research](https://hackernoon.com/token-curated-registries-probably-arent-going-to-change-the-world-b97feb34e99) [has](https://medium.com/wireline/when-can-token-curated-registries-actually-work-%C2%B9-2ad908653aaf) [already](https://multicoin.capital/2018/09/05/tcrs-features-and-tradeoffs/) [been](https://messari.io/resource/token-curated-registries) [conducted](https://medium.com/@tokencuratedregistry/the-token-curated-registry-whitepaper-bd2fb29299d6). The existing research can be referenced, but not copied. We are looking for actionable recommendations specific to a possible re-deployment of the adChain Publisher Registry.
